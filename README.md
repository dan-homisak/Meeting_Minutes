# React + FastAPI + SQLite Starter (Beginner Friendly Guide)

This repository is a fully working “skeleton” web application that you can reuse for future projects. It tries to behave like a desktop app: double-click a launcher, your browser opens to the interface, closing the browser tab shuts everything down, and you can build shareable apps for both macOS and Windows.

The guide below is deliberately detailed. It explains every folder, tool, and button in plain English so that you can return here later—even if you forget how anything works—and get back on track.

---

## 1. Plain-English Concept Tour

| Term | What it means | Why we need it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Python** | A programming language that runs the backend. | Handles server logic, database work, and packaging. |
| **Virtual environment (`.venv`)** | A private copy of Python plus the exact libraries our project needs. | Keeps project dependencies separate so we never break our system Python or other projects. |
| **FastAPI** | A Python library for building web APIs. | Powers our backend routes under `/api/*`. |
| **Uvicorn** | A lightweight Python web server. | Runs the FastAPI app locally or inside the packaged app. |
| **SQLite** | A small self-contained database stored in a single file (`backend/app.db`). | Saves your data without requiring a separate database server. |
| **React** | A JavaScript library for building interactive UIs. | Powers the browser interface located in `frontend/static/app.js`. |
| **PyInstaller** | A Python tool that bundles your app—including Python itself—into one executable. | Creates macOS `.app` bundles and Windows `.exe` files that run on machines without Python installed. |
| **Shell scripts (`.sh` / `.ps1`)** | Small command files for macOS/Linux (`.sh`) and Windows PowerShell (`.ps1`). | They automate setup steps so you can double-click instead of typing commands. |
| **`.app` bundles (macOS)** | macOS “applications” that are really folders containing scripts and resources. | We use them to give you double-click launchers instead of Terminal commands. |
| **Git** | Version-control software that tracks changes to your files. | Lets you undo mistakes, collaborate, and back up your work. |
| **GitHub** | An online host for Git repositories. | Keeps a copy of your project in the cloud and integrates with Codex. |
| **Codex CLI** | The tool that lets this AI assistant work on your local files. | You’ll connect Codex to your GitHub repo so it can assist on future projects. |

Additional autogenerated files:
- `.venv/` (created after setup) — directory holding the project’s private Python.
- `backend/app.db` — SQLite database created the first time the backend runs.
- `dist/` — output of PyInstaller (contains shareable macOS `.app` or Windows `.exe`).
- `launch.log`, `package-macos.log`, `package-windows.log`, `setup.log` — log files produced by the helper apps to aid troubleshooting.

## 3. What You Need Before Starting

### On macOS
1. **Python 3.10 or newer**  
   - Check with `python3 --version`.  
   - If missing, install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or via Homebrew (`brew install python`).
2. **Xcode Command Line Tools** (usually already installed). If not, run `xcode-select --install`.
3. **Optional:** Node.js if you plan to rebuild the React frontend with your own bundler.
4. **Optional but recommended:** Git (`brew install git`) so you can version your work and push to GitHub.

### On Windows
1. **Python 3.10 or newer** with “Add Python to PATH” checked during install.
2. **PowerShell 5+** (included with Windows 10/11).
3. **Optional:** Node.js and Git (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)).

### Why a Virtual Environment Matters
A virtual environment (`.venv/`) is like a sandboxed copy of Python. It keeps:
- The exact versions of libraries our project needs.
- Your system Python clean (no conflicting packages between projects).
- Our packaged app reproducible, because PyInstaller runs inside this controlled environment.

The setup scripts create `.venv/` so you never have to think about it—except to know not to delete it unless you’re resetting the project.

---

## 4. First-Time Setup

### macOS (choose one method)

**Option A: Double-click**
1. Open the project folder in Finder.
2. Double-click `Setup macOS.app`.
3. Wait for success notifications. If something fails, you’ll see a dialog and can open `setup.log` for details.

**Option B: Terminal**
```bash
cd /path/to/Meeting_Minutes
python3 --version          # confirm 3.10+
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

What the setup does:
- Creates `.venv/`.
- Installs all Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Downloads React/ReactDOM UMD files into `frontend/static/vendor/` (if SSL blocking prevents download, the app falls back to the CDN).
- Ensures `.gitignore` contains recommended patterns so personal data (logs, databases, build artifacts) stay out of Git by default.
- Prints a list of outdated Python packages so you immediately know if newer releases are available for the libraries in `requirements.txt`.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
Set-Location C:\path\to\Meeting_Minutes
python --version           # confirm 3.10+
scripts\setup.ps1
```

You’ll see status messages similar to the macOS script. If PowerShell blocks the script, run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
- Just like the macOS script, this setup ensures `.gitignore` includes the safe defaults and displays any outdated Python packages for your awareness (you can upgrade them after reviewing release notes).

---

## 5. Running the App for Development

### macOS (double-click)
1. Ensure setup completed successfully at least once.
2. Double-click `Launch macOS.app`.
3. Your browser opens to the app. When you close the tab, the backend stops automatically.
4. Check `launch.log` if the app doesn’t start or you see errors.

### macOS or Windows (manual command)
```bash
cd /path/to/Meeting_Minutes
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
# .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows PowerShell
python run.py
```

This command:
- Starts Uvicorn with the FastAPI app.
- Opens the default browser to the correct port.
- Stops when you close the tab or press `Ctrl+C`.

---

## 6. Packaging the App for Sharing

### macOS
**One-click:** Double-click `Package macOS.app`.  
What happens:
1. Installs/updates PyInstaller inside `.venv`.
2. Runs PyInstaller with `--windowed` so no Terminal window appears for end users.
3. Produces `dist/SkeletonApp.app`.
4. Deletes the temporary `build/` folder (important: do not run binaries from `build/` because they don’t include Python).
5. Opens the `dist/` folder and pops up a confirmation dialog. The `dist/` folder is ignored by Git, so you can delete it anytime (`rm -rf dist`) to reclaim space.

**Manual CLI equivalent:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
pyinstaller run.py --noconfirm --windowed --name SkeletonApp \
    --add-data "backend:backend" \
    --add-data "frontend/static:frontend/static"
```
After packaging, distribute `dist/SkeletonApp.app`. If you need to share over the internet, zip the app first to keep macOS from stripping metadata.

### Windows
You must run these steps on a Windows machine (physical or VM):
1. Copy the entire project folder to Windows.
2. Open PowerShell and run `scripts\setup.ps1`.
3. Double-click `Package Windows.app` on macOS to read the instructions, or follow them here:
   ```powershell
   Set-Location C:\path\to\Meeting_Minutes
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python -m pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
   python -m PyInstaller run.py --onefile --noconsole --name SkeletonApp ^
       --add-data "backend;backend" --add-data "frontend/static;frontend/static"
   ```
4. The end result is `dist\SkeletonApp.exe`. That single file is fully self-contained—copy it to a USB drive and hand it to someone else. The `dist\` folder is ignored by Git and can be deleted when you’re done testing.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Checklist

### Setup macOS.app fails with SSL/CERT errors
macOS installations of Python sometimes lack root certificates. Run:
```
/Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command
```
Then rerun the setup. If the React download still fails, the script will warn you but the app will fall back to loading React from the public CDN automatically.

### Launch macOS.app says “Missing .venv”
Run `Setup macOS.app` again (or `bash scripts/setup.sh`). The launcher depends on `.venv/.`

### Browser refresh kills the app
This was fixed by the shutdown guard in `backend/app.py`. If it still happens, check `launch.log`. The most common cause is the backend hitting an unhandled exception—look for traceback lines.

### Packaged mac app crashes immediately
Make sure you’re launching `dist/SkeletonApp.app`, not the files inside `build/`. The helper now deletes `build/` to prevent this mistake. If the app still fails, open `package-macos.log` to see PyInstaller’s output.

### Packaged Windows app doesn’t open a browser
Some antivirus software sandboxes `.exe` files on first run. Try right-click → “Run anyway”. If the console window opens but no tab appears, check the log output: pressing `Ctrl+C` may show Python tracebacks with helpful hints.

### Database is corrupted or you want a fresh start
Delete `backend/app.db`. It will be recreated the next time you run the app. Remember that this deletes all saved data.

## 8. Keeping Everything Up to Date

1. **Review the outdated package list** whenever you run the setup scripts—the process automatically prints anything with a newer release so you can evaluate upgrades immediately.
2. **Check Python versions periodically.** Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the latest releases. If you upgrade Python, recreate `.venv/` to ensure compatibility.
3. **Update Python libraries.** You can edit `requirements.txt` with newer versions (e.g., `fastapi==0.115.0`) and rerun `scripts/setup.sh`. Test thoroughly before packaging—some upgrades introduce breaking changes.
4. **React updates.** If you want a newer React version, edit the URLs in `scripts/vendor_react.py` and the CDN fallback inside `frontend/static/index.html`. Re-run the vendor script.
5. **PyInstaller updates.** The packaging scripts already call `pip install --upgrade pyinstaller`, so you automatically get the latest version each time you package.
6. **Document changes.** Whenever you update versions, note it in `README.md` so you remember what changed and why.

Tip: perform updates on a separate Git branch so you can roll back easily if something breaks.

---

## 9. Working with Git and GitHub (No Prior Experience Required)

### A. Install Git
- **macOS:** `brew install git` (or confirm with `git --version`).
- **Windows:** Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and accept defaults.

### B. Initialize the repository locally
```bash
cd /path/to/Meeting_Minutes
git init
```

The setup scripts already created a `.gitignore` with safe defaults (it excludes `.venv/`, logs, databases, PyInstaller output, etc.). Review it and add any project-specific entries you might need later.

### C. Make your first commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of skeleton app"
```

### D. Create a GitHub repository
1. Sign up or log in at [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. Click “New repository”.
3. Name it (e.g., `meeting-minutes-skeleton`), leave it empty (no README), and click “Create repository”.

### E. Link local repo to GitHub
GitHub now shows instructions similar to:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/meeting-minutes-skeleton.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
Run those commands from your project directory (replace `<username>` appropriately).

### F. Connect GitHub repo to Codex
1. In the Codex CLI, run `codex auth login` if you haven’t already.
2. Use `codex repo connect` and follow the prompts to link your GitHub repository.
3. Pull the repo onto your machine (`git clone ...`) when starting fresh, then run `Setup macOS.app` again to recreate `.venv/` locally.

Once connected, you can ask Codex for help on new features, bug fixes, or code reviews in this project or any future project built from this skeleton.

## 10. Manual Command Reference (Quick Copy/Paste)

| Task | macOS/Linux command | Windows PowerShell command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time setup | `bash scripts/setup.sh` | `scripts\setup.ps1` |
| Activate virtual env | `source .venv/bin/activate` | `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |
| Run the app | `python run.py` | `python run.py` |
| Vendor React manually | `python scripts/vendor_react.py` | `python scripts\vendor_react.py` |
| Package for macOS | `pyinstaller run.py --noconfirm --windowed --name SkeletonApp --add-data "backend:backend" --add-data "frontend/static:frontend/static"` | n/a |
| Package for Windows | n/a | `python -m PyInstaller run.py --onefile --noconsole --name SkeletonApp --add-data "backend;backend" --add-data "frontend/static;frontend/static"` |

Remember: when you activate the virtual environment, your prompt usually changes to show `(.venv)`—that’s normal and tells you the environment is active.

---

## 11. If Something Breaks

1. **Read the latest log file** (`setup.log`, `launch.log`, `package-macos.log`, or `package-windows.log`). They usually point directly to the problem (missing dependency, permission issue, etc.).
2. **Search the error message** online. Most issues have existing solutions.
3. **Reset the environment** by deleting `.venv/` and running the setup again.
4. **Ask Codex**. From the Codex CLI you can say “Here’s the error from launch.log—help me fix it.”
5. **Use Git** to revert to a known good commit if recent changes caused the breakage.

---

## 12. Next Steps After Getting Comfortable

- Swap out the React frontend with your own bundle (e.g., Vite or Create React App build output). Just embed the files in `frontend/static/` or point PyInstaller at the build folder.
|- Add more API routes in `backend/app.py` and corresponding UI components.
|- Introduce user authentication, background jobs, or other features.
|- Replace SQLite with another database if your project grows (FastAPI makes it easy to swap).
|- Write automated tests (`pytest`) to ensure future changes don’t break features.

When you start a brand new project, copy this entire folder, rename it, run `Setup macOS.app`, edit the README to match your new app, and you’re ready to go.
